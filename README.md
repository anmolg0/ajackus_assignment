# Chat Assistant

## Explanation of How the Assistant Works

The chat assistant is a Python-based application that accepts natural language queries from users, converts those queries into SQL to fetch data from an SQLite database, and responds to the user with clear, formatted answers. It uses spaCy for natural language processing and pattern matching to identify the type of query and dynamically build the SQL queries accordingly.

### Supported Queries
- "Show me all employees in the [department] department."
- "Who is the manager of the [department] department?"
- "List all employees hired after [date]."
- "What is the total salary expense for the [department] department?"

## Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install sqlite3 spacy
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

2. **Create the SQLite database file**:
    Run the provided script to create the `company.db` database file with the necessary tables and data.

3. **Run the chat assistant**:
    Run the chat assistant script to start the application. The assistant will prompt you to enter queries and respond accordingly.

## Known Limitations or Suggestions for Improvement

### Limitations
- Limited pattern matching: The assistant currently supports a fixed set of query patterns. It may not handle more complex queries or variations in phrasing.
- Dependency on spaCy: The assistant relies on spaCy for natural language processing, which may not always accurately interpret user queries.
- Limited error handling: The assistant has basic error handling but could be improved to handle more specific cases and provide better feedback.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Expand the query patterns: Add more patterns to handle a wider range of queries and variations in phrasing.
- Improve error handling: Enhance error handling to cover more specific cases and provide better feedback to users.
- Integrate more advanced NLP techniques: Use more advanced NLP techniques or models to better understand and interpret user queries.
- Add user authentication: Implement user authentication to provide personalized responses and protect sensitive data.
